# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
 - *I feel good about it!*
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
 - *Generally good! I've done a bit with iterations and conditionals before with other languages, mostly javascript. The syntax is definitely way different, but the general concepts still seem pretty applicable.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
 - *I think I might push myself a bit more with trying to find some additional practice questions that get into some more challenging `each` examples! I don't think I need to adjust my calendar much to fit that in.*
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 - *None at the moment.*
